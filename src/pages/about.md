## who? me?

I was a child of the pre-social network internet, so I had always been interesting in mucking about with programming.  This ultimately culminated in studying Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Connecticut.  Which really just means I studied Computer Science and can kinda read circuit diagrams.

My current gig is working as a Software Consultant in Boston, MA.

So, I'm a programmer by trade and have putzed around with some design and hardware work in my spare time.

My ongoing passion project is [Tono](/projects/tono), a cart based digital music player.  It's a pretty dumb idea, but I really love working on it.
